# Paper Trail History Engine Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Foundation & Dependencies
- [x] Research existing codebase structure and paper_trail integration patterns
- [x] Update gem dependencies to include paper_trail
- [x] Design MVC architecture for version management interface

## Phase 2: Core Models & Data Layer
- [x] Create models to interact with PaperTrail::Version records
- [x] Build service classes for version queries and filtering
- [x] Implement restore functionality for reverting records

## Phase 3: Controllers & Routes
- [x] Define routes for all engine endpoints (`/models`, `/models/:model/versions`, `/versions/:id`, etc.)
- [x] Build controllers:
  - [x] ModelsController (list all models with paper_trail)
  - [x] VersionsController (list/show/restore versions)
  - [x] Search and filtering endpoints

## Phase 4: Views & Interface
- [x] Create layout and styling for the web interface
- [x] Build views:
  - [x] Models index (list all trackable models)
  - [x] Versions index (list versions for model/record)
  - [x] Version show (detailed version view with restore option)
- [x] Implement search and filtering UI components

## Phase 5: Testing & Documentation
- [x] Add comprehensive test coverage for all functionality
- [x] Create installation and usage documentation
- [x] Test integration with dummy Rails app

## Project Goals
This plan delivers a complete mountable Rails engine that provides a web interface for managing PaperTrail versions with all requested features: listing models, viewing versions, restoring records, and search/filtering capabilities.
